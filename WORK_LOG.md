We settled on the fact that you would need to work backwards from the final spot. |

Basically work backwards and create a ladder score for each ladder, which is equal to (ceiling(length of ladder / 6) - ceiling(distance from player / 6)). The ladder with the highest score is the most efficient pick. Yippee! Time to try code it to test it out. |

I'm debugging though, because I returned 2 for the first test when it should be 3. My approach is to use some print statements, so for each time I'm moving my character, I print out the current position, the roll counter, and the position of the next targeted ladder |

|        |    Ended at 12:15    | Okay I did that and then I did a LOT of analysis of my errors and i'm now realizing that I have to start factoring in snakes as a tool here. I don't have the time to code this, but my idea is that basically alongside considering the traditional ladder score I can also consider one where instead of only considering ladders that end sooner than the position of the player (im working backwards here), I'll consider every ladder, and if the ladder is a negative distance from the player (they would need to backtrack to reach it), i'll run a subprogram that sees if there's a route to the top of that ladder via snakes. If there is, it'll calculate the rolls needed to use the snake to reach that ladder, and then factor that into a revamped ladder score! This ladder score will be compared will all other ladder scores (traditional for ladders below; revamped for ladders above). If a backwards ladder has the best score despite requiring a snake-detour to reach, the simulated player will run thru the snakes route. Yay! I think this is a good idea. |
